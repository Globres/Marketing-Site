## A Content Management System in your Bitbucket Repository

*This guest post is written by Mike Neumegen, co-founder of CloudCannon.*

With Bitbucket, developers have great workflows for collaborating on software projects. You can see exactly what has changed when someone makes an update, multiple people can make updates and the same time and new features can be separated into branches.

So why can't we have these workflows when building sites for non-technical users? Database backed content management systems offer basic revision control but they lack the other benefits you get with Bitbucket.

With the CloudCannon Bitbucket add-on, developers get all the advantages of using Bitbucket to build websites **and** non-technical people can update content.

### What is CloudCannon?

CloudCannon helps agencies and enterprises build websites for non-technical users faster.

Developers build a static or [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) site and push it to a Bitbucket repository. CloudCannon synchronizes the files and makes the site live.

Non-technical users log into CloudCannon and update content inline. All changes are kept in sync between CloudCannon and Bitbucket.

### Why use CloudCannon?

Companies like [Netflix](http://cloudcannon.com/customers/netflix/), [Engine Yard](http://cloudcannon.com/customers/engine-yard/),  [Xtendly](http://cloudcannon.com/customers/xtendly/) and [Brandon Setter](http://cloudcannon.com/customers/brandon-setter/) can now rapidly deploy sites for marketing teams and clients.

CloudCannon sites are just static sites which has numerous advantages over database backed CMSs:

* They're simpler to build.
*  All the source files can live in Bitbucket.
* They load faster as there's no backend processing.
* There's less security risk.


We also make it easier for non-technical users:

* Editing is inline so there's no need to preview content.
* Developers control what content and metadata can be updated so there's not an overwhelming array of options.
* Through git branching CloudCannon support multiple environments so changes can be testing on a live site before it's sent to production.


### How do I get started?

Getting a site live using the CloudCannon Bitbucket add-on is easy. First head over to the [Bitbucket Add-On directory](https://bitbucket.org/account/addon-directory/) and install CloudCannon.

Next we need to create a repository with a static or Jekyll site. If you don't have one handy [here's a Jekyll site we prepared earlier](http://docs.cloudcannon.com/creative.zip).
