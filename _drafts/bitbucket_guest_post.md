# A Content Management System in your Bitbucket Repository

_This guest post is written by Mike Neumegen, co-founder of CloudCannon._

With Bitbucket, developers have great workflows for collaborating on software projects. You can see exactly what has changed when someone makes an update, multiple people can make updates and the same time and new features can be separated into branches.

So why can't we have these workflows when building sites for non-technical users? Database backed content management systems offer some revision control but they're heavy weight for the majority of sites.

With the CloudCannon Bitbucket add-on, developers get all the advantages of using Bitbucket to build websites **and** non-technical people can update content.

## What is CloudCannon?

CloudCannon helps agencies and enterprises build websites for non-technical users faster.

Developers build static or [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) sites and push it to a Bitbucket repository. CloudCannon synchronizes the files and makes the site live. There's no servers to set up or software to install.

Non-technical users login to CloudCannon and update content inline. All changes are kept in sync between CloudCannon and Bitbucket.
