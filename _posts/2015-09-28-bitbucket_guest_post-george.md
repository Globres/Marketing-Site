## Updatable websites with Bitbucket and CloudCannon

*This guest post is written by Mike Neumegen, co-founder of CloudCannon.*

Bitbucket provides developers with great workflows for collaborating on software projects. So why can't we have these workflows when building websites for non-developers?

What if you could deploy websites straight from Bitbucket? What if you could build static websites and have the power of a full blown CMS? What if non-developers could update content and have changes pushed back to your Bitbucket repository?

The new CloudCannon Bitbucket Add-on makes all of this possible.

### What is CloudCannon?

[CloudCannon](http://cloudcannon.com) helps agencies and enterprises build websites for non-developers. **Developers** build a static or [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) site and push it to a Bitbucket repository. CloudCannon synchronizes the files and deploys the site live. **Non-developers** log into CloudCannon and update the content inline. All changes are synced between CloudCannon and Bitbucket.

[Netflix](http://cloudcannon.com/customers/netflix/), [Engine Yard](http://cloudcannon.com/customers/engine-yard/), [Agencies](http://cloudcannon.com/customers/xtendly/) and [Freelancers](http://cloudcannon.com/customers/brandon-setter/) use CloudCannon to rapidly deploy websites for marketing teams and clients.

## Introducing the Bitbucket Connect Add-on

With the CloudCannon Bitbucket Connect Add-on, you can work on websites without leaving Bitbucket. Deploy your static/Jekyll website directly from your repository and have non-developers update content in seconds.

To get started, navigate to the [Bitbucket Add-On directory](https://bitbucket.org/account/user/mikeneumegen/addon-directory) and install CloudCannon.

## How it works for Developers

Once you install the Add-on, visit one of your repositories and a CloudCannon option will be available in the sidebar. Selecting this option will allow you to create sites from this repository. If you already have CloudCannon sites attached to this repository they will be visible here.​

Once you add a site, your files are cloned from your selected branch. In a few short moments you will have a live website to test out. CloudCannon automatically compiles, optimises and deploys your site to a CDN. Any changes you make on that branch appear on CloudCannon. As a developer you can update locally through Git or using the CloudCannon code editor. Any changes made on CloudCannon are pushed back to Bitbucket.​

## How it works for Non-developers

Non-developers update content inline without the need to understand Git or the underlying files. CloudCannon abstracts all of that away with a clean and easy to use interface.​

* There's no need to preview content as editing is inline. This is controlled by adding `class="editable"` to any element. CloudCannon uses the semantics of the element to offer more or less controls.
* Eaily update metadata using a generated settings panel. Anything from text to an advanced image picker is configurable.
* Blog posts are updated in a distraction free mode allowing writers to focus. New blog posts are created as a draft and can be published when ready.

## Get started with CloudCannon and Bitbucket

CloudCannon's Bitbucket Connect Add-on enables new workflows for the entire team. Developers can build sites locally and deploy them directly from Bitbucket. Without realising it, non-developers push changes like developers by updating content visually.

If you need help setting up your first site have a read of our [our get started tutorial](http://cloudcannon.com/bitbucket-jekyll/) or get in touch through [support](javascript:void(location.href='mailto:'+String.fromCharCode(115,117,112,112,111,114,116,64,99,108,111,117,100,99,97,110,110,111,110,46,99,111,109))) or posting a comment below.
