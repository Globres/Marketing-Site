## A Content Management System in your Bitbucket Repository

*This guest post is written by Mike Neumegen, co-founder of CloudCannon.*

CloudCannon helps agencies and enterprises build websites for non-developers faster. Bitbucket provides developers with great workflows for collaborating on software projects. You can see exactly what has changed when someone makes an update, multiple people can make updates at the same time and new features can be separated into branches.

So why can't we have these workflows when building websites? Sure you could 

# Deploy from Bitbucket

# Non-developers inline editing

With the new CloudCannon Bitbucket add-on, developers can deploy websites at the click of a button **and** have non-developers update content.

### What is CloudCannon?

CloudCannon helps agencies and enterprises build websites for non-developers faster

Developers build a static or [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) site and push it to a Bitbucket repository. CloudCannon synchronizes the files and deploys the site live.

Non-developers log into CloudCannon and update content inline. All updates are kept in sync between CloudCannon and Bitbucket.



[Netflix](http://cloudcannon.com/customers/netflix/), [Engine Yard](http://cloudcannon.com/customers/engine-yard/), [Xtendly](http://cloudcannon.com/customers/xtendly/) and [Brandon Setter](http://cloudcannon.com/customers/brandon-setter/) use CloudCannon to rapidly deploy websites for marketing teams and clients.

CloudCannon sites are made of static files. Compared to a database backed CMS, there are a number of advantages:

* Less complexity
* All source files can be stored in Bitbucket
* Sites are served faster sites as thereâ€™s no backend processing
* Minimal security risk


CloudCannon makes it easier for non-developers:

* No need to preview content as editing is inline
* No design breaking changes as developers specify which content non-developers can modify
* Changes can be tested on a live staging site before production with Git branching and multiple environments


Now you have a live site you can share with your team or clients. Best of all it's all done inside Bitbucket.

We've only scratched the surface of what CloudCannon can do. Install the CloudCannon Bitbucket add-on today and see how much faster you can build websites for non-developers.
